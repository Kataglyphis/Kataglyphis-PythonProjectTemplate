## About The Project

This project is a template for a Python package named **KataglyphisPythonPackage**.  
Use it as a starting point for creating and deploying your own Python projects.

### Key Features

- Features are to be adjusted to your own project needs.

## Overview

The versioning of the package can be viewed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Getting Started

### Setup

Feel free to adjust for your own environment.
F.e. create a virtual venv with a specific python version.

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
```

### Pre commit hook
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate # .venv/Scripts/activate on pwsh
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# run on all files once (optional)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Installation

There are three major ways to install this package in your environment:

1. **Install directly via pip:**
   ```bash
   pip install KataglyphisPythonPackage@git+https://github.com/Kataglyphis/Kataglyphis-PythonProjectTemplate
   ```
   or install a specific tagged version:
   ```bash
   pip install KataglyphisPythonPackage@git+https://github.com/Kataglyphis/Kataglyphis-PythonProjectTemplate@v0.0.1
   ```

2. **Install after cloning the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kataglyphis/Kataglyphis-PythonProjectTemplate
   pip install .
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   (an editable install: changes in the repo will be reflected in your environment)

3. **Add as a submodule to your repository:**
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/Kataglyphis/Kataglyphis-PythonProjectTemplate
   ```
   Make sure that all dependencies are installed during your repo’s installation.  
   (Not generally recommended, as it can be more complicated.)

### Deployment Recommendations (Hardware/Software)

#### Python package deployment in pure C

For insights into deploying Python packages into production as “binary only” wheels
have a look into the corresponding workflows.  

After creating the wheel you can check content with the command:
```bash
# Unzip a .whl
python -m zipfile --extract <ZIP_DATEI> <ZIEL_ORDNER>
```

This will print all available compatible tags for deployment

```bash
pip debug --verbose
```

**__NOTE:__** If you want to install your package editable and you previously deployed  
it you will need to delete all Cython generated files first. You can use the following  
command for it:  
```bash  
find . -type f \( -name '\*.c' -o -name '\*.cpp' -o -name '\*.so' -o -name '\*.pyd' -o -name '\*.html' \) -delete  
```

Or on windows ... do this  
```powershell  
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -File | Where-Object { $\_.Extension -in '.c', '.cpp', '.so', '.pyd', '.html' } | Remove-Item  
```

## Tests

For development, you can install comprehensive dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -v -e .[dev,docs,test]
```
Then run your testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).
